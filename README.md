# Sheng API README

## Overview

Welcome to the Sheng API! This API serves as the backend for the Sheng Dictionary project, providing functionality to manage users, authentication, and soon, Sheng words. This README provides an overview of the current routes and their purposes. Please note that this documentation is a work in progress as the project evolves.

## Users Route

### 1. Generate Collaborator Token

#### Route
```
POST /users/generate/collabtoken
```

#### Purpose
Generates a token for authenticating as a collaborator to access the database.

### 2. Generate Registration Token (Admin Only)

#### Route
```
POST /users/generate/regtoken
```

#### Purpose
Admin-only route to create a special JWT token. This token is used in a special link provided to potential collaborators, allowing them to create a contributor user account.

### 3. Register User

#### Route
```
POST /users/register
```

#### Purpose
Used by potential contributors to create a user account. Requires a valid registration token generated by the admin.

### 4. Update User Details

#### Route
```
PUT /users/update
```

#### Purpose
Used by contributors to update their user details, such as username, password, etc.

## Word Route (Work in Progress)

The Word Route is currently under development. Once completed, it will provide functionality to retrieve Sheng words from the database.
